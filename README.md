# [Red Hat Common User Experience (RCUE)](http://uxd-rcue.rhcloud.com) reference implementation

The Red Hat Common User Experience (RCUE) project was created to promote design commonality across all of Red Hat’s Enterprise product offerings.

This implementation of RCUE is based on [Bootstrap v2.3.2](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/); therefore, [Bootstrap v2.3.2](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/) is required in order for this reference implementation to work properly.
